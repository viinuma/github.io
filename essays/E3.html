<h3 id="introduction-">Introduction <br /></h3>
<p>The latest WOD, <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html">Invoice 1</a>, involved creating a sales invoice containing 5 or more different products. The invoice includes the following set of information: item, quantity, price, and extended price. Additionally, the invoice includes a subtotal price, along with the taxes and final total.</p>

<h3 id="experience-">Experience <br /></h3>
<p>My experience in completing this latest WOD was definitely a workout. I was a little frustrated that I didn’t complete it on the first attempt because I was so close, maybe just off by a minute. What happened was that I found a minor error with just a few minutes left and I wasn’t able to fix it in time. On the second attempt, I managed to complete it with no issues within the Av time range of about 22 minutes. I think as a whole this WOD was straightforward and not too complicated. The task was burdensome because it involved multiple products with identical sets information, increasing the likelihood of errors.</p>

<h3 id="preparation-">Preparation <br /></h3>
<p>To prepare, I read the instructions carefully and outlined what was needed to accomplish the tasks involved in creating the invoice. For certain tasks that I was unsure about, I reviewed our class notes and the Introducing Expressions and Operators presentation slides before starting. I have learned from working on the other WODs that outlining how to complete the tasks before starting helps and have since applied this approach with our WODs.</p>

<p>What would I have done to be better prepared or what might I try differently for the next WOD? I don’t know that there’s anything that I would’ve done differently, except to be more careful especially when copying and pasting code. Had I been more careful this time around, maybe I would’ve completed the WOD on my first attempt within the required time.</p>
